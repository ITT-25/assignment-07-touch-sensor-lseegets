## Lee-Ann Seegets (15/20P)

### Build a Camera-Based Touch Sensor (8.5/10P)
* Hardware is assembled correctly
    * nothing is secured, no markers on how to place the camera (-1P)
* Bounding boxes around fingers are detected robustly, palm-rejection works
    * palm-rejection sometimes unreliable (-0.5P)
* Movement and taps can be distinguished and sent via DIPPID, making it compatible with the given Fittsâ€™ Law application
    * yep (3P)
* Automatic calibration works
    * yep (1P)
* Documentation
    * yep (2P)

### Touch-based Text Input (6.5/10P)
* Detection of finger or stylus works
    * yep (1P)
* Input is captured and pre-processed reasonably
    * minimalistic, could be extended for better predictions (-1P)
* Reasonable approach for hand-writing recognition
    * reasonable, but does not work (-1P)
* Robust detection
    * nopes (-1P)
* Acceptable latency
    * yep (1P)
* Mapping of handwriting to keyboard
    * only lower case recognized (-0.5P)
* Documentation
    * yep (2P)
